I have hardwood floors and a cat, and when I clean around the cat's litter, it shoots the litter all over the room making me do even more work in the end.  I would have to remove the detachable nozzle and manually clean up the cat litter.  Also, the vacuum is very powerful and shredded some wires that were too close to me while cleaning - something that has never been a problem before.  In addition, this vacuum is extremely loud - to the point where it makes my ears ring.  The whole neighborhood knew I had gotten a new vacuum. My boyfriend has had enough of the noise and we are shopping for a new one.", "expected": ["#PerformanceAndFunctionality", "#CustomerExperienceAndExpectations"], "sentiment": ["N", "N"]}, {"text": "Good thing i only needed this because of the attachment because it would pick up anything on the floor not happy with this at all", "expected": ["#PerformanceAndFunctionality"], "sentiment": ["N"]}, {"text": "First of all I'm a Dyson fanatic....I have a total of three (one on each floor).  When we bought our cabin I couldn't stand to give one up and felt too cheap to buy another one (they are pricey) for carpet I'm on five or six times a year so I bought this.  At first I was thrilled.  It was wonderful.  After using it a few times however it has completely lost suction.  Keep in mind this is being used in a second home with no kids, pets or real dirt.  I would doubt that it's on except that it's noisy and takes off without me.  I have bought new filters and looked for blockages but nothing has worked.  Also the \"dirt container\" is sometimes hard to remove and put back.  Feels like it's catching on something.  What a waste of money.  Even in my college days I've never had a worse vacuum.  I highly recommend the Dyson instead or even the $50 Dirt Devil I gave my niece as a wedding present- it cleans circles around this thing.

I really thought my 10 year old Eureka wasn\u2019t that bad, replaced it because it was so heavy. Turns out, wasn\u2019t working at all. I like everything about this little Dirt Devil except it doesn\u2019t stand up on its own, but that\u2019s a minor quibble.<br />Great little vacuum cleaner, so glad I bought it.", "expected": ["#ValueForMoneyAndInvestment", "#DesignAndUsabilityIssues"], "sentiment": ["P", "P"]}, {"text": "Got this exact model from Walmart for just under $130 + tax.  Assembly was easy, although the pictures on the guide sheet are not easy to follow.  One plastic tab snapped off the hose bracket when I pressed it in place.  I decided not to bother taking it back.<br /><br />As a cleaner, it is literally amazing.  I watched my carpets  go from grimy gray to blue, and dog hair and dust particles removed from various nooks and crannies with the tools.<br /><br />BUT... once the canister is full it is literally a nightmare to clean.  Pulling it out results in a shower of grime.  And emptying it out required me to literally bend up a metal coat hanger and spend a good 15 minutes pulling and digging matted hair out of the innards, where it gets trapped between various internal projections.  Shaking, pounding and trying to pull different parts apart did nothing.  Now maybe this won't be a problem if pet hair is not a major ingredient on your floor but I see other complaints here about the canister design.  And the problem is far worse if you overfill the canister, so you have to track the level like a hawk.  Who needs that?<br /><br />I'd give this unit 5 stars other than the canister problem.  Eureka needs to redesign the canister and make a built-in plunger you can simply depress to push the dirt out -- voila!  I'd pay an extra 20 bucks for that, easily.
